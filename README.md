# Wiz-Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, a retro-themed, pixel-art inspired single-page application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Features

- **Retro Pixel-Art Design**: A unique, visually engaging design that mimics classic video game UIs.
- **Internationalization**: Supports both English and Spanish, with content loaded from JSON files.
- **Dark Mode**: A toggle for switching between light and dark themes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Custom-built, interactive components like a pixelated portrait and themed contact modal.
